This plugin adds categories and tags to the WordPress media library - lightweight and developer-friendly.

== Description ==

The plugin adds two taxonomies to the WordPress media library which are then available to categorize and tag your attachments. By default, these taxonomies, although sharing the same names and behavior, are separate from the default post taxonomies, but this can easily be changed if desired.

The plugin follows WordPress Core principles and offers a lightweight alternative to similar approaches which often tend to be incredibly flexible, but at the same time complicated and bloated. And if you have a little knowledge of code, you should be able to adjust the plugin exactly to your needs if the default configuration doesn't satisfy you.

= Features =

* Adds categories and tags to the Media Library (independent from the regular post categories and tags)
* Inserts filter dropdowns for attachment taxonomies into the media toolbar and media modal
* Allows to pick taxonomy terms for attachments from within the Attachment Selection & Edit modals
* Adds a setting for the default attachment category
* Enhances the `[gallery]` shortcode so that images of a specific attachment taxonomy can be included automatically

= Quality attributes =

* Lightweight plugin following WordPress Core principles
* "Decisions, not Options"
* Can easily be used as a must-use plugin
* Provides a flexible API to add other attachment taxonomies or disable the existing ones for developers
* Provides an easy-to-use `has_default` argument that can be used when registering an attachment taxonomy in order to automatically add a setting for the default taxonomy term

== Installation ==

= As a regular plugin =

1. Upload the entire `attachment-taxonomies` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or download it through the WordPress backend.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= As a must-use plugin =

If you don't know what a must-use plugin is, you might wanna read its [introduction in the WordPress Codex](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/must-use-plugins/).

1. Upload the entire `attachment-taxonomies` folder to the `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` directory (create the directory if it doesn't exist).
2. Move the file `/wp-content/mu-plugins/attachment-taxonomies/attachment-taxonomies.php` out of its directory to `/wp-content/mu-plugins/attachment-taxonomies.php`.

Note that, while must-use plugins have the advantage that they cannot be disabled from the admin area, they cannot be updated through WordPress, so you're recommended to keep them up to date manually.

= Administration =

Once the plugin is activated, you will see two new submenu items under Media (Categories and Tags), where you can manage available attachment categories and tags.
If you like, you can set a default category to apply to new attachment uploads, via using the added dropdown on the _Settings > Writing_ screen.

The plugin follows the WordPress Core philosophy "Decisions, not Options" - therefore there is no additional settings screen. However, the plugin is easily extendable and adjustable by developers (see [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/attachment-taxonomies/faq/)). So if the base configuration does not suit your needs, it shouldn't be too hard to change that.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Note that all code samples below should be run before the `init` action hook and not earlier than the `plugins_loaded` (or `muplugins_loaded` if you use the plugin as a must-use plugin) hook.

= How can I add more attachment taxonomies? =

You can simply use the WordPress Core function [`register_taxonomy()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_taxonomy/) and specify `'attachment'` as the second parameter. As an alternative, you can create your own class for the taxonomy, extending the abstract `Attachment_Taxonomy` class provided by the plugin. Then you can add it using the method `add_taxonomy( $taxonomy )` of the class `Attachment_Taxonomies`.

Example Code (adds an attachment taxonomy called "Location"):

`
<?php

final class Attachment_Location extends Attachment_Taxonomy {
	protected $slug = 'attachment_location';
	protected $labels = array(
		'name'				=> __( 'Locations', 'textdomain' ),
		'singular_name'		=> __( 'Location', 'textdomain' ),
		/* more labels here... */
	);
	protected $args = array(
		'hierarchical'		=> true,
		'query_var'			=> 'location',
		/* more arguments here... */
	);
}

add_action(
	'plugins_loaded',
	function() {
		Attachment_Taxonomies::instance()->add_taxonomy( new Attachment_Location() );
	}
);

`

= How can I remove the default attachment taxonomies? =

To remove one of the default attachment taxonomies you should call the method `remove_taxonomy( $taxonomy_slug )` of the class `Attachment_Taxonomies`.

Example Code (removes the attachment taxonomy "Category"):

`
<?php

add_action(
	'plugins_loaded',
	function() {
		Attachment_Taxonomies::instance()->remove_taxonomy( 'attachment_category' );
	}
);

`

= How can I use the regular post categories and post tags for attachments instead of the additional taxonomies ? =

To accomplish that, first you need to remove the two taxonomies that the plugin adds (`attachment_category` and `attachment_tag`). See above for instructions on how to do that.

Then you can simply use the WordPress Core function [`register_taxonomy_for_object_type()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_taxonomy_for_object_type/) and specify `'attachment'` as the second parameter. As an alternative, you can create your own instance of the `Attachment_Existing_Taxonomy` class provided by the plugin. Then you can add it using the method `add_taxonomy( $taxonomy )` of the class `Attachment_Taxonomies`, as seen in the example below.

Example Code (makes the regular category and tag taxonomies available for attachments):

`
<?php

add_action(
	'plugins_loaded',
	function() {
		Attachment_Taxonomies::instance()->add_taxonomy( new Attachment_Existing_Taxonomy( 'category' ) );
		Attachment_Taxonomies::instance()->add_taxonomy( new Attachment_Existing_Taxonomy( 'post_tag' ) );
	}
);

` 

= How do I use the enhanced version of the `[gallery]` shortcode? =

The `[gallery]` shortcode can now be passed taxonomy attributes. They have to have the attachment taxonomy slug as the attribute name and a comma-separated list of term slugs or term IDs as value. You may also specify a new "limit" attribute to limit the amount of images shown. This is especially recommended if the attachment taxonomy term you are querying for contains a lot of images. As of version 1.2.0, the plugin furthermore supports an optional "tax_relation" attribute, which you can set to "AND" in order to show only images that satisfy _all_ of the taxonomy attributes provided on the shortcode.

Example Code (shows images with attachment categories 1 or 2 or attachment tag 5 with a limit of 20 images shown):

`
[gallery attachment_category="1,2" attachment_tag="5" limit="20"]
`

Example Code (shows images with attachment categories 1 or 2 _and_ attachment tag 5):

`
[gallery attachment_category="1,2" attachment_tag="5" tax_relation="AND"]
`

Note that there is currently no UI in the backend for this, and the preview in the editor will not work properly. It will show up correctly in the frontend though.

= Which filters are available in the plugin? =

The plugin provides some filters to adjust taxonomy arguments and labels.

* `attachment_taxonomy_args` where first argument is the array of taxonomy arguments and the second argument is the taxonomy slug that these arguments apply to
* `attachment_taxonomy_{$taxonomy_slug}_args` where the only argument is the array of taxonomy arguments for the taxonomy defined by `$taxonomy_slug`
* `attachment_taxonomy_labels` where first argument is the array of taxonomy labels and the second argument is the taxonomy slug that these labels apply to
* `attachment_taxonomy_{$taxonomy_slug}_labels` where the only argument is the array of taxonomy labels for the taxonomy defined by `$taxonomy_slug`
* `attachment_taxonomy_class_names` where the only argument is the array of class names of the taxonomies to register by default
